the bot's available functionality.

## Specification
ArcBot is designed for the JVM. That being said, the entire bot, as you may have noticed, is not entirely coded in base 
java. ArcBot's core frameworks -- BotFrame, LoggerFrame and the Utility classes are completely and entirely in base
java; however, each additional module: Level, Report, Appeal, Apply, etc. are each coded in a different language called
kotlin. Kotlin uses similar constructs to Java, but the code is much more concise, the compiler is more intelligent,
the entire language is designed with modernity and simplicity in mind. As it stands now, Java and Kotlin will be the 
only languages used on this project; however, if there comes a time that these two cannot properly meet the expectations
that we have for ArcBot, another JVM-based language (like Scala or Groovy) may also be used. For a full specification
list (what's required of you for pull requests to be accepted), please see this page. (Link Coming Soon)

## Credits / Legal
ArcBot was conceived and designed by the development team at ArcStone Development LLC. While the bot is completely open
sourced, unless you get specific permission, we would like for individual users to __not__ host their own copies of this
bot. With that said, we do appreciate users using this code as a base for their own projects and would love to see any 
work/feedback anyone may have! If you do use this code in your own project, please be sure to leave our development team
some credit (we have worked hard too).
