Once you have added the bot to your server, please read the setup page on the wiki 
[here](https://github.com/ArcStoneDevelopment/ArcBot/wiki/Setting-Up-Your-ArcBot) to make sure you make the most out of 
the bot's available functionality.

## For the Future
When ArcBot v1.0 is released, a permanent version of the javadocs for the whole project will be available in the web format.
For the time being, if you wish to read the unfinished javadocs, the `DOC` folder in the repository root contains the files
for the javadoc.

## Credits / Legal
ArcBot was conceived and designed by the development team at ArcStone Development LLC. While the bot is completely open
sourced, unless you get specific permission, we would like for individual users to __not__ host their own copies of this
bot. With that said, we do appreciate users using this code as a base for their own projects and would love to see any 
work/feedback anyone may have! If you do use this code in your own project, please be sure to leave our development team
some credit (we have worked hard too).
